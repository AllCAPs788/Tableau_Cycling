# Cycling Through the Years

Note: the visualizations for this project can be found at: https://public.tableau.com/profile/clark.pfifer#!/vizhome/CyclingThroughtheYears/CityMap?publish=yes 

This project provides visualizations for CitiBike data using Tableau. 

## The Big Picture

Visualizations provided are here to tackle two trends:

1. Age vs. Trip duration 
2. Station use by gender

## Analysis

Each trend has two visualizations related to either age or gender. They are then combined into a dashboard and a story for each trend. 

Further analysis is explored [**here**](https://github.com/AllCAPs788/citibike_tableau/blob/master/Analysis.md).
