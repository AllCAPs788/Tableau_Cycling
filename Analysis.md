# Citibike Analysis

In going though my data, I found the following two data trends breaking down variables regarding gender and age. 

## Trend 1:

The first trend I visualized was the counts of male vs. female bikers per each station. The station with the largest number of male users was Pershing Square North (6,508 men versus 794 women). Somers Street and Broadway had the lowest representation for both male and female representation (3 and 0 respectively).  
The West 21 Street and Sixth Avenue station had the largest female representation at 1,677 users (versus 4,545 male cyclists).

The overall totals of male to female is 695,884 to 212,896 cyclists. This means that male-to-female ratio is appoximately 7 to 3 in favor of male usage. It should be noted that there were null fields (no gender listed), but I wanted to limit the focus to male versus female. 

## Trend 2:

Another phenomena that I traced was age vs. average trip duration and the total trip durations in minutes by decade of birth. 

From the data I found one particular quirk: for a modern service, some of the users were born well over a hundred years ago. 

This leads me to assume two important things:

1. Vampires live amongst us and
2. they still travel by bicycles.

You may asking "Aren't vampires averse to sunlight, and therefore incapable of taking the documented bike trips during daylight hours?" You would be correct in the traditional Nosferatu/Dracula sense. But, as will be apparent below, I am going to here on refer to these subjects as the vampire/human hybrids known as Daywalkers (as defined in the 1998 film, Blade).

This presents even more worrying possibilities;

1. The predominant vampire population has merged with humanity in a new evolution of its species (a la I am Legend) or 
2. Following Blade rules even further, there is such a large existing population of traditional vampires that the necessary ratio of Daywalker bounty hunters has increased to meet this rising threat to the human race. 

From there, we can draw more analysis from these daywalker abominations walking the streets of New York. At least the proportion of elder daywalkers (those born before 1910) has the smallest representation of total trip duration.

In addition, I will rule out a couple of other immortal species. These most likely are not Highlanders (as the population is too large when there can only be one). Secondly, while it's possible the possible that the population simply consists of benign immortals, it should not proclude potential threat posed by superhuman beings to our society.
